# NAVE-Sketch-Retriveal
Norm-guided Adaptive Visual Embedding for Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval.
# Devolepment
-Siamese network, pretrained SeResNet, transformation layers ( linear layers ) \\
-Training loop using mutli task learning by "Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics" paper in order not 
to noise regularizer. \\
# Working on
- Test loop (It is completely different from training loop)
